# Custom-Connectors
the files displayed here are open api files which can be used to create custom connectors in Powerapps.
This blog https://sharepoint-specialist.nu/custom-connector-authentication-to-the-graph-microsoftflow-468b494d15bf describes how to use them.

I create these connectors as i will need them myself in the feature. Feel free to download and use them they all use the Microsoft Graph.
